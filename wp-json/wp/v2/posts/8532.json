After Dark transforms the Manhattan Bridge Archway Plaza and the surrounding neighborhood into a giant arcade through a mixture of social party games, large physical video games, and wild new street games.

From small indoor games to outdoor public spectacles, After Dark turns your Friday night into a playful adventure.<\/p>\n<h2>What to Play at After Dark<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lost in Time<\/strong>: Players use a smartphone app to role play as crack journalists and track down all-American poet Walt Whitman, who has become unstuck in time and lost in DUMBO.
