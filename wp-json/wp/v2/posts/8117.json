To create a truly immersive environment, we seamlessly integrated 1,700-square-feet of motion-activated LED displays into the architectural surfaces of the lobby.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the displays, ESI also designed custom lighting, sound and media content to deliver a cohesive multi-modal experience. For example, some lights change color temperature to reflect the media that is playing. The environment is further enhanced by ambient sounds emerging from invisible speakers in the walls and ceiling creating a fully immersive environment for visitors to experience.<\/p>\n<p>The displays are an ever-evolving artwork that creates a sense of place and reacts to the presence of people. The Seasons content mode is quite popular as it connects Terrell Place with its Washington D.C. neighborhood including its iconic cherry trees.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the final results here:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/193762129\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>How the Seasons Mode Responds to People<\/h2>\n<p>The Fall Seasons mode begins with the lush green leaves of late Summer, which slowly transform into a vibrant landscape of yellow, orange, and red, then start to drift to the ground. The leaves change color as people walk by, and butterflies flutter above people who pause to watch. Passing through a doorway causes a gust of wind to rustle the leaves on nearby branches, so that some fall and swirl with the wind.<\/p>\n<p>In the Winter cherry blossom mode, tree branches are bare and snow flurries circle the landscape. As people pass by, icicles grow and the snowfall increases. Where people stand still, frost appears, like frost on a window. Eventually the snow and icicles begin to melt as we move back into Spring.<\/p>\n<h2>See more of Terrell Place<\/h2>\n<p>Read more about our work at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.esidesign.com\/work\/terrell-place-washington-dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terrell Place<\/a> and if you are looking for a way create more immersive environments for your building, we can help. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.esidesign.com\/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get in touch<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re excited to announce that ESI Design\u2019s installation at Terrell Place in Washington D.C. has won Gold at the APEX Awards for best immersive environment.
